# DPtree represents the flow of data from the sensor to the cloud.
# - the root node is the sensor
# - the internal nodes are DataProcessors that process the data in some way
# - the edges are the data flow between the nodes
#
# DPtree supports the following methods for building the tree:
# - connect(from, to): connect two nodes in the tree
# - chain(): connects multiple nodes along a single edge
#
# DPtree supports the following methods for traversing the tree:
# - get_processors(): returns a list of all processors in the tree
# - search(): searches the tree for a node with the given attributes
#
# connect(from, to) and chain() are used to build the tree.
# - 'from' accepts either a Sensor or a DataProcessor object.
# - 'to' accepts a DataProcessor object.
#
# The first call to connect() or chain() must supply a Sensor object which
# will create the root node of the tree.
#
# The DPtree is built in a top-down fashion, starting from the root node and working down to the leaf nodes.
# The DPtree creates DPtreeNode objects for each node in the tree.
