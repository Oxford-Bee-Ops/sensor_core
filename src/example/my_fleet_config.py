# SensorCore config model
#
# At the top level, we are defining configuration for a fleet of devices.
# This fleet config must be returned as a list of DeviceCfg objects.
# The inventory is passed to SensorCore when it is first configured:
#
#   SensorCore.configure(fleet_config=example.my_fleet_config.INVENTORY)
#
# The DeviceCfg contains:
# - name: a friendly name for the device (eg Alex)
# - notes: free-form notes on what the device is being used for (eg "Experiment 1")
# - system: a SystemCfg object which defines how the system parameters, such as cloud storage configuration
# - sensor_ds_list: a list of SensorDsCfg objects defining each Sensor and its associated Datastreams
#
# A Datastream defines a source of data coming from a Sensor.
# A Sensor may produce multiple Datastreams, each with a different type of data.
# The Sensor configuration is stored in a SensorCfg object.
# The Datastream configuration is stored in a DatastreamCfg object.
# The combined config of a sensor and its datastreams are in a SensorDsCfg object.
#
# The data produced by a Datastream (eg video files) may be processed by 0 or more DataProcessors.
# In the video file example, a DataProcessor might use an ML algorithm to identify bees in a video
# and output the number of bees identified.
# DataProcessors act in a chain, with data being passed from one to the next.
# The DataProcessors associated with a Datastream are defined on the DatastreamCfg
# as lists of DataProcessorCfg objects.
# There are two lists:
#  - EdgeProcessors that act on the device
#  - CloudProcessors that act as part of a subsequent ETL on a server or in the cloud.
#
# DeviceCfg (1 per physical device)
# -> sensor_ds_list: list[SensorDsCfg] - 1 per Sensor)
#    -> [0]
#       -> sensor_cfg: SensorCfg
#       -> datastream_cfgs: list[DatastreamCfg]
